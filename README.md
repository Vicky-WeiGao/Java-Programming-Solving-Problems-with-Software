# Java-Programming-Solving-Problems-with-Software
This course is offered by Duke University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming) and is part of the specialization: [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming).<br> 
I finished the course in two weeks with honors and with 100% grade when working a full time job. Here is the [link](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/ATR2E3VKPUSH) to the certificate.
## Course Description
Learn to code in Java and improve your programming and problem-solving skills. You will learn to design algorithms as well as develop and debug programs. Using custom open-source classes, you will write programs that access and transform images, websites, and other types of data. At the end of the course you will build a program that determines the popularity of different baby names in the US over time by analyzing comma separated value (CSV) files. 
## What will be learned
1. Edit, compile, and run a Java program;
2. Use conditionals and loops in a Java program;
3. Use Java API documentation in writing programs. 
4. Debug a Java program using the scientific method;
5. Write a Java method to solve a specific problem;
6. Develop a set of test cases as part of developing a program;
7. Create a class with multiple methods that work together to solve a problem; and
8. Use divide-and-conquer design techniques for a program that uses multiple methods.
